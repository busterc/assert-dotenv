# assert-dotenv

**assert-dotenv = [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) + [dotenv-assert](https://github.com/busterc/dotenv-assert)**

One fell swoop for loading and asserting environment settings in node.

## Version 1.0.0

## Why use assert-dotenv

- Storing [configuration in the environment](http://www.12factor.net/config) is one of the tenets of a [twelve-factor app](http://www.12factor.net/).
- Implicit default settings can lead to confusing troubleshooting scenarios and should be avoided entirely.
- `.env` files contain setting keys and values, therefore, they should not be checked into version control repositories.
- The `assert.env` file only lists what environment settings (keys) are required without providing values like private tokens, passwords, etc. and therefore can and should be checked into version control repositories.

## How does it work

An exception is thrown if any of these cases are true:
  - An `.env` file is not found
  - An `assert.env` file is not found
  - The keys listed in the `assert.env` file are not set in the `.env` file
  - An Options Object or Callback Function are not passed in arguments

Otherwise, your environment settings are applied and your application executes as expected.

## Installation
```sh
$ npm install --save assert-dotenv
```

## Usage
```javascript
/**
*  load .env and assert.env files from CWD or
*  from the nearest parent directory where they are found
*/
require('assert-dotenv')({}, function() {
  console.log('Environment Settings Loaded and Asserted!');
});

/**
*  or, specify custom file locations
*/
require('assert-dotenv')({
  dotenvFile: '../configs/env.config',
  assertFile: '/Users/me/assert-files/express.env'
}, function() {
  console.log('Environment Settings Loaded and Asserted!');
});

/**
*  or, specify a custom file names, that will be loaded from
*  CWD or the nearest parent directory where each file is found
*/
require('assert-dotenv')({
  dotenvFile: 'settings.env',
  assertFile: 'settings.assert'
}, function() {
  console.log('Environment Settings Loaded and Asserted!');
});
```

## Simple HTTP Server Example

- ~/app/.env

  ```
  IP=127.0.0.1
  PORT=1337
  ```

- ~/app/assert.env

  ```
  IP
  PORT
  ```

- ~/app/index.js

  ```javascript
  require('assert-dotenv')({}, function() {
    var http = require('http');

    http.createServer(function (request, response) {
      response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
      response.end('Hello World\n');
    }).listen(process.env.PORT, process.env.IP);

    console.log('Server running at http://' + process.env.IP + ':' + process.env.PORT + '/');
  });

  ```

- _Start the server and see that all is well_

  ```sh
  $ node index.js
  Server running at http://127.0.0.1:1337/
  ```
